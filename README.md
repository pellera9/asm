## Your AI agent skills are a mess

You use Claude Code at work, Codex for side projects, and OpenClaw for experiments. Each tool keeps skills in its own hidden directory with its own conventions. Here's what that looks like in practice:

- **Skills scattered everywhere** — `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/`, project-level `.claude/skills/`... you have the same skill installed three times and can't remember which version is where
- **No visibility** — there's no quick way to see what's installed, what's duplicated, or what's outdated across all your agents
- **Installing is manual and risky** — you clone repos, copy folders, hope the SKILL.md is valid, and pray you didn't just install something that exfiltrates your codebase

The more AI agents you use, the worse this gets. Every new tool adds another skill directory to babysit.

## `asm` brings order to the chaos

**agent-skill-manager** is a single command that manages skills across every AI coding agent you use. One TUI. One CLI. Every agent.

- **See everything at once** — List, search, and filter skills across all providers and scopes from one dashboard. No more `ls`-ing through hidden directories.
- **Install from GitHub in one command** — `asm install github:user/repo` handles cloning, validation, and placement. Supports single-skill repos, multi-skill collections, subfolder URLs, and private repos via SSH.
- **Catch problems before they bite** — Built-in security scanning flags dangerous patterns (shell execution, network access, credential exposure, obfuscation) before you install. Duplicate audit finds and cleans redundant skills across providers.
- **Create, test, and publish skills** — Scaffold new skills with `asm init`, symlink them for live development with `asm link`, audit for security issues, verify metadata, and publish to the [ASM Registry](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm-registry) with a single command. [See the full local dev workflow &darr;](#build-test-and-ship-your-own-skills)
- **Works with every major agent** — 19 providers built-in: Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, GitHub Copilot, Aider, OpenCode, Zed, Augment, Amp, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, Pi, Hermes, and a generic Agents provider. Add custom providers in seconds via config.
- **Two interfaces, one tool** — Full interactive TUI with keyboard navigation, search, and detail views. Or use the CLI with `--json` for scripting and automation.

## How it works

1. **Install `asm`** — one command via npm or curl
2. **Run `asm`** — it auto-discovers skills across all configured agent directories
3. **Manage everything** — install, search, inspect, audit, and uninstall skills from the TUI or CLI
4. **Stay safe** — security scan skills before installing, detect duplicates, and clean up with confidence

## Build, Test, and Ship Your Own Skills

`asm` isn't just for consuming skills — it's the complete toolkit for **creating, developing, auditing, and testing skills locally** before you share them.

### 1. Scaffold a new skill

Interactive mode — pick a target tool:

```bash
asm init my-skill
```

Scaffold directly into Claude Code:

```bash
asm init my-skill -p claude
```

Scaffold in a custom directory:

```bash
asm init my-skill --path ./skills
```

This creates a `my-skill/SKILL.md` with valid YAML frontmatter and a markdown template ready to fill in.

### 2. Develop with live reload via symlink

`asm link` creates a symlink from your local skill directory into an agent's skill folder. Because it's a symlink, every edit you make to the source is immediately visible to the agent — no reinstall needed.

#### Target a specific tool

```bash
# Link into Claude Code
asm link ./my-skill -p claude

# Link into Codex
asm link ./my-skill -p codex

# Interactive — pick the tool from a prompt
asm link ./my-skill
```

#### Link multiple skills at once

Pass several paths in a single command to link them all in one step:

```bash
asm link ./skill-a ./skill-b ./skill-c -p claude
```

You can also point at a folder that contains multiple skills (each in its own subdirectory with a `SKILL.md`):

```bash
# Link every skill found inside ./my-skills-folder
asm link ./my-skills-folder -p claude
```

#### Override the symlink name

```bash
asm link ./my-skill --name my-alias -p claude
```

#### Force-overwrite an existing symlink

```bash
asm link ./my-skill -p claude --force
```

Edit the source files — changes are reflected immediately in the agent. This is the fastest iteration loop for skill development.

### 3. Audit your skill for security issues

Audit an installed skill by name:

```bash
asm audit security my-skill
```

Audit a local directory:

```bash
asm audit security ./path/to/my-skill
```

Audit every installed skill:

```bash
asm audit security --all
```

The security scanner flags dangerous patterns — shell execution, network access, credential exposure, obfuscation, and external URLs — so you can catch problems before users install your skill.

### 4. Inspect and verify metadata

Check name, version, description, file count:

```bash
asm inspect my-skill
```

Machine-readable output for CI:

```bash
asm inspect my-skill --json
```

### 5. Test the install flow locally

Once your skill is on GitHub, verify that end users can install it cleanly.

Install your own skill as a user would:

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill
```

Install to a specific tool:

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill -p claude
```

Install a specific skill from a multi-skill repo:

```bash
asm install github:you/skills --path skills/awesome-skill
```

Force reinstall to test upgrades:

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill --force
```

Non-interactive install (useful for CI):

```bash
asm install github:you/awesome-skill -p claude --yes --json
```

This catches issues that local development misses — broken repo structure, missing files, invalid frontmatter in a clean install context.

### 6. Publish to the ASM Registry

Once your skill is ready and on GitHub, submit it to the [ASM Registry](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm-registry) so anyone can install it by name:

```bash
asm publish ./my-skill
```

This runs a security audit, generates a signed manifest, forks the registry, and opens a pull request automatically. Once merged, your skill is globally discoverable:

```bash
# Anyone can install it by name — no URL needed
asm install my-skill
```

Preview what the manifest will look like before submitting:

```bash
asm publish --dry-run ./my-skill
```

Override security warnings (caution: review findings first):

```bash
asm publish --force ./my-skill
```

Skip confirmation in CI:

```bash
asm publish --yes ./my-skill
```

> **Requires:** [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com) authenticated with `gh auth login`. The publish command uses `gh` to fork the registry, create a branch, write the manifest, and open the PR — all without leaving your terminal.

### Typical local development workflow

1. **Scaffold** — `asm init awesome-skill -p claude`
2. Edit your `SKILL.md`
3. **Link for live testing** — `asm link ./awesome-skill -p claude`
4. Test with your AI agent
5. **Security audit** — `asm audit security awesome-skill`
6. **Verify metadata** — `asm inspect awesome-skill`
7. **Score quality** — `asm eval ./awesome-skill`
8. Push to GitHub
9. **Verify install flow** — `asm install github:you/awesome-skill`
10. **Publish to registry** — `asm publish ./awesome-skill`

Whether you're building skills for yourself or publishing them for the community, `asm` gives you the full create → develop → audit → ship pipeline in one tool.

---

## Skill Verification

Skills indexed by `asm` are automatically evaluated against a set of verification criteria. Skills that pass all criteria receive a **verified** badge in the catalog and `"verified": true` in the index JSON. Skills that fail any criterion are still indexed but marked as unverified.

### Verification Criteria

A skill must satisfy **all four** of the following to be verified:

1. **Valid frontmatter** -- The SKILL.md file must contain YAML frontmatter with both a `name` and a `description` field. Empty or whitespace-only values fail this check.

2. **Meaningful body content** -- The markdown body (everything after the frontmatter block) must contain at least 20 characters of instruction text. A SKILL.md that is only frontmatter with no real guidance for the agent will fail.

3. **No malicious patterns** -- The full SKILL.md content is scanned for dangerous code patterns:
   - `atob()` calls (runtime base64 decoding / obfuscation)
   - Suspicious base64-encoded strings (40+ character base64 blocks with padding)
   - Hex-escape sequences (4+ consecutive `\xNN` escapes)
   - Hardcoded credentials (`API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, or `PASSWORD` assignments)

4. **Proper structure** -- The skill directory must exist and contain a `SKILL.md` file that the ingestion pipeline can read.

### How to Reproduce Locally

You can verify your skill before publishing:

```bash
# Index your repo -- verification runs automatically during ingestion
asm index ingest github:your-user/your-repo

# Check the output JSON for the verified field
asm index search "your-skill" --json
```

Each indexed skill in the output JSON includes `"verified": true` or `"verified": false`. If verification fails, the ingestion debug log (set `ASM_DEBUG=1`) prints the specific reasons.

### Quality Evaluation (`asm eval`)

Static verification tells you the SKILL.md is well-formed. `asm eval` goes further: the built-in `quality` provider runs a scored rubric over structure, frontmatter, clarity, prompt engineering, context efficiency, safety, testability, and naming — and emits per-category scores plus concrete suggestions for improvement. Zero setup, zero API keys, zero external binaries.

```bash
# Score the skill and print recommendations
asm eval ./my-skill

# CI-friendly machine-readable output
asm eval ./my-skill --machine

# Apply deterministic auto-fixes to SKILL.md
asm eval ./my-skill --fix

# List registered eval providers
asm eval-providers list
```

The eval surface is a pluggable provider framework: each provider implements a common `EvalProvider` contract and resolves via semver range. See [`docs/eval-providers.md`](./docs/eval-providers.md) for the provider model.

---

## ASM Registry — Install and Publish Skills by Name

The [ASM Registry](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm-registry) is the curated index of community-published skills. Once a skill is listed, anyone can install it by name — no GitHub URL needed.

### Install from the registry

```bash
# Install by bare name (searches the registry)
asm install code-review

# Install by scoped name (author/skill — always unambiguous)
asm install luongnv89/code-review

# Force a fresh registry fetch (bypasses the 1-hour cache)
asm install code-review --no-cache
```

`asm install` resolves the name against the registry index, downloads the manifest, clones the exact pinned commit, and installs the skill to your agent.

### Publish your skill to the registry

```bash
asm publish ./my-skill
```

The publish pipeline:

1. **Validates** your `SKILL.md` frontmatter (name, description, version)
2. **Security audit** — blocks dangerous skills automatically; warns on risky patterns
3. **Generates a manifest** with the current commit SHA and a `skill_path` for multi-skill repos
4. **Opens a PR** against [luongnv89/asm-registry](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm-registry) via the `gh` CLI

The registry CI validates schema, checks author identity, runs a duplicate check, typosquat detection, and an independent security scan before any maintainer reviews. Once merged, the index rebuilds automatically and your skill is live.

| Flag        | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--dry-run` | Preview the manifest without creating a PR |
| `--force`   | Override warning-level security findings   |
| `--yes`     | Skip the confirmation prompt               |
| `--machine` | Output as a machine-readable JSON envelope |

### How registry resolution works

When you run `asm install code-review`:

1. `asm` fetches the registry index (cached for 1 hour at `~/.config/agent-skill-manager/registry-cache.json`)
2. Finds the manifest for `code-review` — including the pinned `commit` and `skill_path`
3. Clones the repository at that exact commit and navigates to the skill subdirectory
4. Installs as if you had run `asm install github:author/repo#commit:skill_path`

If multiple authors publish a skill with the same name, `asm` shows a disambiguation prompt. Use a scoped name (`author/skill`) to skip it.

### Shadowed installs

If you have multiple `asm` binaries on `PATH` (for example, a leftover install from an older package manager), shells resolve whichever appears first and a fresh upgrade can be silently shadowed.

**Diagnose:** `asm --version` detects and warns when it sees multiple `asm` binaries on `PATH`. For a full report, run `asm doctor` — it lists the resolved path and any shadowed installs.

**Fix:** remove the stale install with your package manager, then re-run `asm --version` to confirm only one binary is left.

## FAQ

**Is it free?**
Yes. `asm` is MIT licensed and free forever. No accounts, no telemetry, no paywalls.

**Is it actively maintained?**
Yes — actively developed with frequent tagged releases (46 and counting, latest v2.11.0). Check the [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

**Which AI agents does it support?**
19 providers built-in: Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, GitHub Copilot, Aider, OpenCode, Zed, Augment, Amp, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, Pi, Hermes, and a generic Agents provider. All 19 are enabled by default; disable any you don't need via `asm config edit`. You can also add any custom agent that stores skills as directories with a `SKILL.md` file.

**How does it compare to managing skills manually?**
Manual management means remembering where each agent stores skills, cloning repos by hand, checking for duplicates yourself, and having no security scanning. `asm` automates all of that with one command.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/asm-audit.png" alt="asm audit — duplicate detection across providers" width="700" />
  <br/><em>asm audit — finds duplicate groups and tells you exactly which to keep</em>
</p>

**Can I use it with private repos?**
Yes. Use `--transport ssh` or `--transport auto` to clone private repos via SSH.

**Is it safe to install skills from GitHub?**
`asm` includes built-in security scanning that flags dangerous patterns (shell execution, network access, credential exposure, obfuscation) before installation. Run `asm audit security github:user/repo` to scan any skill before installing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/asm-audit-security-oss-ready.png" alt="asm audit security — security scanning report" width="700" />
  <br/><em>asm audit security oss-ready — flags external URLs, shell execution, and credential access</em>
</p>

**What's the SKILL.md format?**
Every skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name, description, version) followed by markdown instructions the AI agent loads at runtime. Run `asm init my-skill` to scaffold one.

### Global Options

```text
-h, --help             Show help for any command
-v, --version          Print version and exit
--json                 Output as JSON (list, search, inspect, audit)
-s, --scope <scope>    Filter: global, project, or both (default: both)
--sort <field>         Sort by: name, version, or location (default: name)
-y, --yes              Skip confirmation prompts
--no-color             Disable ANSI colors
```

### Examples

List all global skills sorted by provider location:

```bash
asm list --scope global --sort location
```

When you have many skills installed, `asm list` offers condensed views:

```bash
asm list --summary            # counts by tool/scope/effort only
asm list --compact            # one line per skill
asm list --group-by tool      # group rows under tool headers
asm list --limit 20           # show only the first 20 rows
```

Search for skills and output JSON:

```bash
asm search "code review" --json
```

Inspect a specific skill:

```bash
asm inspect my-skill
```

Remove duplicates automatically:

```bash
asm audit --yes
```

Security audit a skill before installing:

```bash
asm audit security github:user/repo
```

Audit all installed skills:

```bash
asm audit security --all
```

Score a skill with the static quality provider:

```bash
asm eval ./my-skill
```

List registered eval providers:

```bash
asm eval-providers list
```

Scaffold a skill, link it for live testing, audit, and inspect:

```bash
asm init my-skill -p claude
```

```bash
# Link globally (available in all projects)
asm link ./my-skill -p claude

# Link multiple skills at once
asm link ./skill-a ./skill-b -p claude
```

```bash
asm audit security my-skill
```

```bash
asm inspect my-skill --json
```

Uninstall without confirmation:

```bash
asm uninstall old-skill --yes
```

Index a skill repo and search it:

```bash
asm index ingest github:anthropics/skills
```

```bash
asm index search "frontend design" --json
```

**Skill bundles** — install a curated set of skills in one command. Pre-defined bundles ship with ASM for common workflows (frontend, devops, iOS release, content writing). Browse them at [luongnv.com/asm/#/bundles](https://luongnv.com/asm/#/bundles) or list them locally:

```bash
asm bundle list --predefined
```

Install every skill in a pre-defined bundle:

```bash
asm bundle install frontend-dev
```

Install from a bundle file (custom or shared):

```bash
asm bundle install ./my-bundle.json
```

Build a custom bundle from your installed skills, then export it to share:

```bash
asm bundle create my-workflow
asm bundle export my-workflow ./my-workflow.json
```

A bundle is a JSON file with a `name`, `description`, `author`, and a list of `skills` (each with `name` + `installUrl`). The schema is validated on install — see `src/utils/types.ts` (`BundleManifest`). You can also assemble a custom bundle visually on the website's [/bundles](https://luongnv.com/asm/#/bundles) page and export it as JSON.

**iOS/Swift catalog note:** ASM indexes public, installable Swift and Apple-platform skill repos from maintainers such as Hacking with Swift (`twostraws`), Antoine van der Lee (`AvdLee`), Dimillian, Rudrank Riyam, and Ivan Magda. Use `asm bundle install ios-release` for a curated SwiftUI, concurrency, testing, persistence, Xcode build, App Store, and release-management starter set, or search the catalog for `swift`, `swiftui`, `swift testing`, `uikit`, `swiftdata`, or `app store connect` to install individual skills. Sources that are private, landing-page-only, or do not expose discoverable `SKILL.md` content are not added as enabled catalog entries.

<summary><strong>Installing Skills from GitHub</strong></summary>

Install skills directly from GitHub repositories — supports both single-skill repos and multi-skill collections.

**Single-skill repo** (SKILL.md at root):

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill
```

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill#v1.0.0 -p claude
```

**Multi-skill repo** (skills in subdirectories):

```bash
asm install github:user/skills --path skills/code-review
```

```bash
asm install github:user/skills --all -p claude -y
```

Interactive picker:

```bash
asm install github:user/skills
```

**Subfolder URL** (auto-detects branch and path):

```bash
asm install https://github.com/user/skills/tree/main/skills/agent-config
```

```bash
asm install github:user/skills#main:skills/agent-config
```

**Private repos** (SSH transport):

```bash
asm install github:user/private-skill --transport ssh
```

Try HTTPS, fallback to SSH:

```bash
asm install github:user/private-skill -t auto
```

**Vercel skills CLI** (delegates to `npx skills add`, then registers in asm):

```bash
asm install github:user/skills --method vercel --skill my-skill
```

```bash
asm install https://github.com/user/skills -m vercel --skill my-skill -y
```

**Other options:**

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill --name custom-name
```

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill --force
```

```bash
asm install github:user/my-skill -p claude --yes --json
```

**Source format:** `github:owner/repo[#branch-or-tag]` or `github:owner/repo#ref:path` for subfolder installs. HTTPS GitHub URLs with `/tree/` paths are also supported — the branch and subfolder are auto-detected.

**Install flags:**

| Flag                     | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --tool <name>`      | Target tool (claude, codex, cursor, windsurf, etc.)        |
| `--name <name>`          | Override skill directory name                              |
| `--path <subdir>`        | Install a specific skill from a subdirectory               |
| `--all`                  | Install all skills found in the repo                       |
| `-m, --method <method>`  | Install method: `default` or `vercel` (default: `default`) |
| `--skill <name>`         | Alias for `--path` (Vercel skills CLI compatibility)       |
| `-t, --transport <mode>` | Transport: `https`, `ssh`, or `auto` (default: `auto`)     |
| `-f, --force`            | Overwrite if skill already exists                          |
| `-y, --yes`              | Skip confirmation prompt                                   |
| `--json`                 | Output result as JSON                                      |

**Multi-skill repo support:** `asm` scans for skills in subdirectories (up to 5 levels deep). Repos with only nested skills use that scan by default. Repos with **both** a root `SKILL.md` and nested skills install the root skill by default; use `--all` to install every discovered skill (root plus nested). In interactive mode, discovery shows a numbered picker. Use `--path` to target a specific skill.

**Indexing (`asm index ingest` / `npm run preindex`):** Discovery always includes a root `SKILL.md` when present **and** any nested skills in subdirectories, so curated indexes do not silently drop skills when a repo adds a root-level skill.

The install command clones the repository, validates `SKILL.md` files, scans for security warnings, previews skill metadata, and installs to the selected provider's global skill directory. Requires `git` on PATH.

<summary><strong>SKILL.md Format</strong></summary>

Every skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. The file starts with a YAML frontmatter block followed by markdown instructions that the AI agent loads at runtime.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: "A short description of what this skill does"
license: "MIT"
compatibility: "Claude Code, Codex"
allowed-tools: Bash Read Grep Glob WebFetch
effort: medium
metadata:
  version: 1.0.0
  creator: "Your Name <you@example.com>"
---
```

| Field              | Required | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | :------: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             |   yes    | Unique skill identifier (used in list/search)       |
| `description`      |   yes    | One-line summary shown in listings                  |
| `license`          |    no    | SPDX license identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`) |
| `compatibility`    |    no    | Comma-separated list of compatible AI agents        |
| `allowed-tools`    |    no    | Space or comma-delimited tool names the skill uses  |
| `effort`           |    no    | Effort level: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max`     |
| `metadata.version` |    no    | Semver version string (defaults to `0.0.0`)         |
| `metadata.creator` |    no    | Author name and optional email                      |

> **Version resolution:** `asm` prefers `metadata.version` over a top-level `version` field. If neither is present, the version defaults to `0.0.0`. Both formats are supported for backward compatibility.

### Body

The markdown body after the frontmatter is loaded by the AI agent as the skill's instructions. A typical structure:

```markdown
# my-skill

Describe what this skill does here.

## When to Use

- Trigger conditions for this skill

## Instructions

- Step-by-step instructions for the agent
```

### Scaffold a new skill

Creates `my-skill/SKILL.md` in the default provider:

```bash
asm init my-skill
```

Creates in Claude Code's skill directory:

```bash
asm init my-skill -p claude
```

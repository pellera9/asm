# Changelog

## v2.8.0 — 2026-05-20

### Features

- `asm uninstall <name>` — new command with full reverse-installation logic. Supports `-s <scope>` and `-t, --tool <provider>` filters, automatically relocates the real folder to another surviving provider when the canonical host is being removed, cleans up empty parent dirs, and shows scope/tool/relocation info in the confirmation prompt ([#279](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/279)) — @luongnv89
- New `refresh-index` skill — re-ingests every already-enabled repo in `data/skill-index-resources.json` in one guided workflow (sync, classify into updated/unchanged/failed/skipped, verify catalog, then a confirmation-gated commit + PR). Inverse of `skill-index-updater` ([#290](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/290)) — @luongnv89
- Reorder install tool list by user preference — `DEFAULT_PROVIDERS` now leads with claude, codex, opencode, pi, hermes, openclaw; added the `pi` provider; `mergeWithDefaults` now inserts newly-introduced default providers in their canonical priority slot (anchored to the nearest preceding default), so existing users see the new order on upgrade ([#291](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/291)) — @luongnv89
- Repo-derived bundles — repo indexing now emits zero/one/multiple bundle records per repository, with explicit bundle metadata merged with best-effort inference. Bundles are exposed via CLI bundle load/list and the website bundle catalog; provenance to source repo and skill paths is preserved. 196 inferred bundles refreshed across 28 repos ([#275](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/275)) — @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- `asm uninstall <name> -t <provider>` now preserves the `.skill-lock.json` entry (source-tracking metadata: `source`, `commitHash`, `ref`) when other providers still have the skill installed, so subsequent `asm list`/`asm update` keep working on the survivors. When a real-folder relocation moves the canonical home to a kept provider the lock entry's `provider` field is repointed; when no relocation happened the entry is left intact. The full-uninstall path (no `-t`) still drops the entry as before ([#284](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/284)) — @luongnv89
- Uninstaller now cleans up partial state on EXDEV cp fallback failure — when cross-device move fails mid-copy, the partial destination is removed instead of being left as half-written content ([#283](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/283)) — @luongnv89
- Uninstaller surfaces relocation failures via non-zero exit code — relocation errors are no longer swallowed, so CI and scripted callers see the failure ([#282](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/282)) — @luongnv89
- `fix(test):` Bundle modify/export tests no longer leak installed skill copies into the user's real `~/.claude/skills/`. Each test creates its source dir as `<tmpRoot>/<frontmatter-name>/` so the installer's destination basename matches the cleanup lookup; a per-test `assertSkillUninstalled` guard fails the test if the install survives, plus a one-shot `beforeAll` sweep removes any `cli-skill-for-*` leftovers from prior runs ([#288](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/288)) — @luongnv89
- `fix(ci):` Replace apt-based trivy install with a binary download to avoid Azure mirror timeouts in the security workflow

### Documentation

- Document `asm bundle` command and the predefined bundles in the README ([#202](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/202)) — @luongnv89

### Chores

- Supply-chain hardening across npm and GitHub Actions — pinned versions, ignore-scripts hardening, lockfile checks, dependency cooldown declaration ([#277](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/277)) — @luongnv89
- Refresh indexed skill sources across all 30 curated repos — net skill count updated across the catalog ([#295](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/295)) — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0

## v2.7.0 — 2026-05-10

### Features

- Add Quick Start section to the catalog skill detail page — guided three-step workflow (Security Check, Quality Evaluation, Install) with copy-to-clipboard buttons ([#273](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/273)) — @luongnv89
- Add `romainsimon/paperasse` to the curated skill index — 6 French bureaucracy skills (commissaire-aux-comptes, comptable, controleur-fiscal, fiscaliste, notaire, syndic) covering administrative procedures and document handling ([#267](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/267), [#271](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/271)) — @luongnv89
- Re-sync `coreyhaines31/marketingskills` — 1 new co-marketing skill added ([#268](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/268)) — @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- `fix(test):` Update skill-detail tests for UI changes
- `fix(test-spawn):` Kill children on parent disconnect

### Documentation

- `docs(security):` Skill audit for issue #269 — security scan of 284 installed skills against prompt injection and credential theft risks, zero strict-risk hits found ([#270](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/270)) — @luongnv89

### Chores

- Re-sync all 30 curated skill sources — net skill count updated across the catalog
- Clean up repository and expand `.gitignore` — removed tracked backup files, added dev tool directories (`.cursor`, `.aider`, `.continue`, `.windsurf`, `.zed`, `.fleet`) and build/cache log patterns

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.6.2...v2.7.0

## v2.6.2 — 2026-05-07

### Chores

- Index 2 new curated skill sources — `warpdotdev/oz-skills` (15 skills for Warp AI agents) and `entireio/skills` (5 cross-agent skills for context and session handoff); regenerated catalog totals 7036 skills across 31 repos ([#264](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/264)) — @luongnv89
- Dedupe same-name skills within a single repo by directory priority — when one repo ships a skill at multiple supported install paths, keep exactly one entry using a deterministic order (`skills/` > `.claude/skills/` > `.agent/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` > first occurrence); cross-repo duplicates remain independent and dropped paths are logged via `--verbose` ([#265](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/265), [#266](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/266)) — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.6.1...v2.6.2

## v2.6.1 — 2026-05-03

### Bug Fixes

- `asm link` now handles non-existent paths and directory symlinks gracefully — bare registry-style names (e.g. `asm link code-review`) and missing paths exit 1 with a polished error and an `asm install <name>` suggestion instead of crashing with a Node stack trace; the top-level path probe now uses `stat` instead of `lstat` so directory symlinks are followed (re-linking an already-linked skill works), while inner-loop entry classification still uses `lstat` to avoid traversing nested symlinks ([#262](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/262)) — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.6.0...v2.6.1

## v2.6.0 — 2026-05-01

### Features

- Add `skill-upstream-pr` built-in skill — forks a target repo via `gh`, delegates the improvement loop to `skill-auto-improver`, and opens a friendly suggestion PR upstream with an `asm eval` before/after metrics table; mandatory preview/approval before any public action and a minimum-delta check skip trivial PRs ([#244](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/244)) — @luongnv89
- `asm eval` now accepts `author` as the canonical frontmatter field, with `creator` retained as a legacy alias — autofixer writes `author:` going forward, and legacy skills declaring `creator:` keep their score with no migration required ([#243](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/243)) — @luongnv89
- `asm eval` `skill-best-practice` provider (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0) — align with the latest `skill-creator` standard (v1.7.1): add `xhigh` to the effort enum, warn when descriptions exceed the 250-char runtime budget (truncation chops the negative-trigger clause), require `metadata.version` (semver-formatted), warn when `metadata.author` is missing, and require frontmatter `name` to match the parent directory ([#246](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/246)) — @luongnv89
- `skill-auto-improver` (v0.2.0 → v1.0.2) — adapt the skill itself and its workflow to the `skill-creator` standard, restructured around two gates: Gate 1 (skill-creator must-pass floor) and Gate 2 (asm-eval 85/8 quality floor); adds a Phase 1 frontmatter-normalization step after `asm eval --fix`, new `references/skill-creator-checklist.md` and `references/frontmatter-audit.md` playbooks, dual-gate report layout, and per-loop `metadata.version` bump for the target skill ([#253](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/253)) — @luongnv89
- Add `Paramchoudhary/ResumeSkills` as a curated source in the skill-index — 20 resume optimization and job-search skills (76 `SKILL.md` entries including cross-platform mirrors) covering ATS optimization, bullet writing, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, interview prep, salary negotiation, and executive/academic/creative resumes ([#256](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/256)) — @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- Website list now surfaces a muted `relPath` sub-label on rows whose `owner/repo::name` collides — plugin-bundle repos ship the same skill name at multiple install paths, and identical-looking cards (matching name, owner/repo, description, badges) made the duplicates indistinguishable; non-colliding rows are unchanged ([#241](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/241)) — @luongnv89
- `asm install` now treats `skills/x-skill` and `./skills/x-skill` identically — when the input contains a path separator and resolves to an existing directory in the current working directory, it is treated as a local path rather than dispatched to the registry as a scoped name ([#249](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/249)) — @luongnv89
- `asm install --path` and `--all` now compose correctly — when `--all` is set and the resolved path contains skill subdirectories, ASM scans subdirectories instead of failing on missing `SKILL.md`; when a subpath is supplied with `--all`, duplicate detection is scoped to that prefix so unrelated dupes don't abort the install; the zero-skills error message is also scope-aware ([#251](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/251), [#252](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/252)) — @luongnv89

### Chores

- Refresh the bundled `skills/skill-creator/` skill to the upstream version — pulls in updated references, scripts, and templates used by `skill-auto-improver` and `skill-upstream-pr` — @luongnv89
- Add a local-first security baseline plus CI mirror — pre-commit hook runs `gitleaks` (secrets), `trivy` (dependencies), and `semgrep` (static analysis) offline, exits non-zero on HIGH/CRITICAL, and writes JSON + Markdown reports under `security/`; `.github/workflows/security.yml` mirrors the same runner on push to `main` and pull requests, with the trivy DB cache keyed on a weekly stamp ([#257](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/257)) — @luongnv89
- Bring `skill-index-updater` up to the `skill-creator` standard — move `README.md` under `docs/`, normalize frontmatter (`metadata.version` + `metadata.author`, drop top-level `version`), rewrite the description under the 250-char runtime budget with a negative-trigger clause, and add `When to Use` / `Example` / `Expected Output` / `Edge Cases` sections; `asm eval` 76 (C) → 97 (A) with every category >= 8 ([#258](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/258)) — @luongnv89
- Re-sync all 27 enabled skill sources via `bun run preindex` — picks up upstream additions, removals, version/description bumps, and refreshed `evalSummary` + `tokenCount` for every skill; net delta +51 skills (6797 → 6848) ([#260](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/260)) — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.5.0...v2.6.0

## v2.5.0 — 2026-04-24

### Features

- Add a bundle builder UI to the catalog website — interactive cart flow lets users browse skills, add any to a persistent (localStorage) cart visible from the header across all routes, fill bundle metadata (name/description/author/tags), then either export a `BundleManifest`-conforming `.json` or publish a pre-filled feature request issue to promote the bundle. Validation mirrors the CLI's `validateBundle()` rules and truncation keeps the issue URL under GitHub's ~8KB pre-fill limit ([#238](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/238), [#240](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/240)) — @luongnv89
- Add `google/skills` and `antonbabenko/terraform-skill` as curated sources in the skill-index — 13 Google product/technology skills plus a Terraform/OpenTofu skill for AI agents ([#237](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/237)) — @luongnv89
- `asm eval` now warns when `README.md` sits at the skill root — flags a common packaging mistake that previously slipped through scoring ([#227](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/227), [#234](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/234)) — @luongnv89
- Redesign the website `/changelog` page with an editorial release-log aesthetic — two-column layout with a Fraunces + Instrument Serif masthead, a JetBrains Mono sticky version index, monospace metadata strip, outlined tag pills, and numbered receipt-style entries separated by dashed rules; self-scoped `.cl-*` styles preserve existing `ENTRIES` data verbatim and work in both light and dark themes — @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- Deploy Skill Catalog workflow now also triggers on changes to `website-src/**` and `package.json` — previously release commits that bumped only those paths would not fire the workflow, leaving the live site stale (e.g. the v2.4.0 release left the nav pill showing 2.3.0 because `skills.min.json` was never regenerated on CI) — @luongnv89

### Chores

- Remove the `eu-project-ops` predefined website bundle and update bundle tests and the website changelog bundle count to match the reduced set — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.4.0...v2.5.0

## v2.4.0 — 2026-04-23

### Features

- Drop Bun from the toolchain — replace `@opentui/core` with `ink` for the TUI so CLI and TUI both run on Node >=18 alone, removing the `bun:ffi` native dependency ([#224](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/224), [#226](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/226)) — @luongnv89
- Make `bun` optional at install time — CLI runs on Node, Bun is only required for interactive TUI mode ([#221](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/221), [#223](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/223)) — @luongnv89
- Add `skill-auto-improver` built-in skill — eval-driven improvement loop that runs `asm eval`, applies deterministic `--fix`, then iterates per-category playbook edits until a skill clears the 85/8 quality floor (overallScore > 85 AND every category >= 8) or stops with a blocker report. Self-dogfooded: scores 100/100 with every category at 10/10 ([#209](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/209), [#218](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/218)) — @luongnv89
- Ship 5 curated pre-defined bundles with ASM for popular workflows (`frontend-dev`, `devops`, `ios-release`, `content-writing`, `eu-project-ops`) — add `--predefined` flag on `asm bundle list` to show shipped bundles ([#206](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/206), [#211](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/211)) — @luongnv89
- Add `asm bundle modify` and `asm bundle export` subcommands — non-interactive editing via `--add`, `--remove`, `--description`, `--author`, `--tags`, plus an interactive prompt mode and JSON export with `--force` / `--json` ([#204](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/204), [#205](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/205), [#208](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/208)) — @luongnv89
- Rewrite the ASM catalog website on React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui — replaces the 4.4k-line single-file `index.html`, retains full feature parity (catalog list, category tabs, facets, repo/sort selects, MiniSearch prefix + fuzzy search, pagination, bundle list, skill detail), and introduces a NeuronWiz-style sidebar + detail two-pane layout for catalog and bundles ([#228](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/228), [#229](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/229), [#230](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/230), [#231](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/231)) — @luongnv89
- Add `/bundles` page to the ASM catalog website — each bundle card shows name, description, tags, included skills, and a copy-paste install command; deploy pipeline triggers on `data/bundles/**` changes ([#207](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/207), [#215](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/215)) — @luongnv89
- Add `/docs` and `/changelog` SPA pages to the React website so header nav stays internal instead of bouncing to GitHub — @luongnv89
- Consolidate mobile header actions (theme toggle, GitHub link, nav items) into a single burger menu at `<=768px` with aria-expanded, aria-controls, Escape-to-close, and outside-click dismissal ([#216](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/216), [#217](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/217)) — @luongnv89
- Pin `skill-auto-improver` to the top of the catalog as a featured skill, with a distinct visual treatment ([#219](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/219)) — @luongnv89
- Restore full website nav (Docs, Changelog, version pill, GitHub star count) and switch the catalog sidebar to `react-window` virtualization — cuts click latency on the 6,783-skill catalog from ~10s to instant ([#232](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/232)) — @luongnv89
- Use the real ASM nexus logo in the website header — @luongnv89

### Performance

- Split `catalog.json` into a compact list + a MiniSearch index — faster initial load and smaller per-request payloads on the website ([#214](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/214), [#220](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/220)) — @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- Include `relPath` in the catalog dedup key so plugin-bundle variants aren't dropped — recovers ~3k installable targets that the `owner/repo::name` key had silently collapsed; adds regression tests asserting `totalSkills === skills.length` and unique `installUrl` per entry ([#201](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/201), [#203](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/203)) — @luongnv89
- Opt into React Router v7 future flags (`v7_startTransition`, `v7_relativeSplatPath`) to silence v6 deprecation warnings — @luongnv89
- Import test accounts for missing providers so the test suite runs cleanly when optional providers aren't installed — @luongnv89

### Changed

- Rename eval provider ID `skill-creator` → `skill-best-practice` to avoid collision with the real Anthropic `skill-creator` skill; include warning-severity checks in the score denominator; add per-check `√`/`×`/`⚠` breakdown under each extra provider's score line — @luongnv89

### Testing

- Isolate publisher and import tests from host `gh` CLI and skill-provider state via a `fakeGhCli()` helper — removes five flaky tests that depended on the developer's local environment ([#167](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/issues/167), [#200](https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/pull/200)) — @luongnv89
- Deflake runner timing assertions by bumping sleeps to 20ms and assertions to `>=10ms` for headroom against `Math.round` jitter — @luongnv89
- Stub `ResizeObserver` in jsdom smoke tests so `react-window` v2 renders under Vitest — @luongnv89

### Chores

- Ignore `.agents/` directory in git — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0

## v2.3.0 — 2026-04-21

### Features

- Add skill-best-practice deterministic provider (#197, #198) @luongnv89
- asm eval accepts GitHub refs and batch-evaluates collections (#196) @luongnv89
- scannable asm list output for large inventories (#192, #195) @luongnv89
- Multi-axis filtering and search highlighting on catalog page (#186) @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve escaped entities in highlights @luongnv89
- Fix keyboard activation on install CTA and sort safety on unknown grades (#186) @luongnv89

### Documentation

- Fold asm eval into skill-index-updater step 3 @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/asm/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0

## v2.2.0 — 2026-04-20

### Features

- Show estimated token count and `asm eval` scores on every consumer surface — website cards/modal, TUI list/detail, and CLI inspect. Token count uses a `words + spaces` heuristic labelled with `~`; eval scores include overall score, letter grade, per-category breakdown, and an explicit empty state pointing to `asm eval <skill>` when data is missing. Catalog payload is the single source of truth, so all 3,140 indexed skills carry both signals ([#191](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/191), closes [#187](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/issues/187), [#188](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/issues/188)) — @luongnv89

### Documentation

- Refresh the website Documentation page with the full `asm` command reference — adds 6 missing commands (`import`, `outdated`, `update`, `doctor`, `bundle`, `config path`), expands global-options and install-flags tables, and adds per-command sections with flags and runnable examples for `list`, `search`, `inspect`, `audit`, `uninstall`, `stats`, `doctor`, `bundle`, `index`, `outdated`/`update`, `export`/`import`, and `config` ([#190](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/190), closes [#189](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/issues/189)) — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0

## v2.1.0 — 2026-04-20

### Features

- Add `heygen-com/hyperframes` to the curated skill index — 5 new skills for HTML-based video composition, CLI tooling, registry blocks, website-to-video capture, and GSAP animation reference ([#184](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/184)) — @luongnv89
- Re-index `mattpocock/skills` (18 → 21 skills) ([#183](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/183)) — @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- Scan 5 levels deep when discovering skills — previously capped at 3, which missed skills nested under `plugins/<group>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`. Re-indexed all curated repos: catalog grew from ~1,700 to 3,135 skills across 24 repos ([#185](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/185)) — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0

## v2.0.0 — 2026-04-19

### Breaking Changes

- Drop the `skillgrade` runtime provider and its bundled binary — `asm eval <skill>` is now zero-config (no external binary, API key, Docker, or `eval.yaml`). The built-in `quality` provider scores every skill out of the box ([#180](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/issues/180), [#182](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/182)) — @luongnv89
- Remove CLI flags `--runtime`, `--runtime init`, `--preset`, `--provider`, `--compare`, `--threshold`, and the `ASM_SKILLGRADE_BIN` env var. CI pipelines using these flags will fail on upgrade — drop the flags and rely on the default quality provider — @luongnv89
- Remove `docs/skillgrade-integration.md` — @luongnv89

### Changed

- Cut ~5–10 MB from the npm tarball by dropping `skillgrade` from `dependencies` and `bundledDependencies` — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/compare/v1.22.0...v2.0.0

## v1.22.0 — 2026-04-19

### Refactors

- Detect PATH shadowing from npm and bun globals during install — warn when a stale global binary shadows the locally installed `asm` ([#177](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/177), [#178](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/178)) — @luongnv89
- Expand `skillgrade-missing` error with a manual fallback message — guide users through installing Skillgrade by hand when automatic install fails ([#173](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/173), [#176](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/176)) — @luongnv89

### Bug Fixes

- Bundle `skillgrade` via `bundledDependencies` so it ships inside the `asm` package and is always available without a separate install step ([#172](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/172), [#175](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/175)) — @luongnv89
- Auto-initialise `eval.yaml` when missing and fix a misleading init hint that pointed to the wrong command ([#171](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/issues/171), [#170](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/issues/170), [#174](https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/pull/174)) — @luongnv89

### Testing

- Resolve macOS symlink path inconsistency in test suite and exclude the plugin provider from the public export to prevent test noise — @luongnv89

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/luongnv89/agent-skill-manager/compare/v1.21.0...v1.22.0

## v1.21.0 — 2026-04-19

### Features
